This archive contains resources for CS 410P/510 Sound Spring
220 HW #3, `chord`. Included here are:

* `C-equal.wav`: Sample output for a C-major chord in equal
  temperament.

* `Ebm-just.wav`: Sample output for an Eâ™­m (E flat minor)
  chord in just temperament.

* `tables.py`: Tables for note name to MIDI key number and
  for just temperament multipliers from base frequency.
  These should be pretty usable in non-Python programs.

* `checkclip.py`: Python program for comparing a reference
  `.wav` file to a test output. (This is what I use as an
  aid when grading.) It requires the Python `soundfile`
  package.
